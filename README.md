# LaLiga-Analysis

In the DataAnalysisExercises.pdf document there are some statistical questions about the matches played in the Spanish football league "La Liga" trough all its history.  
  
In the Analysis folder there is a Jupyter Notebook with all the solutions, with its corresponding graphs and plots, and the matches.csv document with all the information about all the matches played in the league since its creation in 1929 until 2022.    
When running the jupyter notebook, it automatically stores two processed tables with the final standings of each division at the end of every season and jorney respectively in the Standings folder.  
You can find also the requiements for running the notebook in the main folder.  
  
This project is made in collaboration with Ismael Bueno Bernardos in the context of the Reserach and Innovation subject of the UAB master degree in Modelling for Science and Engineering.
