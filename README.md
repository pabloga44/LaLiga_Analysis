In the Analysis folder there is the Jupyter Notebook with all the solutions, with its corresponding graphs and plots.  
When running the jupyter notebook, it stores two processed tables with the final standings of each division at the end of every season and jorney respectively in the Standings folder.  
You can find also the requiements for running the notebook in the main folder.
